HackaTruck MakerSpace Cognitive Services is a professional training project for students from Information Technology Higher Education Institutions, developing iOS for mobile applications with application in the Internet of Things (IoT), emphasizing the application of concepts and practices of cognitive services in cloud. The project is sponsored by IBM Brasil and Flex, in collaboration with Apple, and executed by the Eldorado Research Institute.

## General objective

Development of an MVP mobile app for iOS, within 30 days.

## About the ColetaAi app

Its main objective was to provide information to the user that it was time for them to collect their full trash; asking the cooperatives to go to the user's house to collect the trash and, as the user practices collective collection more, they will receive cashback on their profile, as a form of bonus.

## How it Works 

The ultrasonic sensor would be responsible for sending information to the cloud that your smart bin is already full. It works by taking the difference in volume between the edge and the height of the trash inside the bin. Once this is done, the data in the cloud would be directed to the app, notifying the user. Therefore, the user would only need to click on "Collect" and the application would call a cooperative (something like a selective garbage truck). After the cooperative stops by the user's house and collects their trash, the user would earn a few cents.
